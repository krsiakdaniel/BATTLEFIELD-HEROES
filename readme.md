# Battlefield Heroes - Website in PHP

- This was 1 month challenge back in 2009 to learn the basics of **HTML**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **Adobe Photoshop**.
- The website landed me my first IT job in IBM ðŸ™‚

## Localhost

- Install PHP on your local machine `brew install php`
- Type `make start` to run the website.
- Or run this command directly: `php -S localhost:8000`
