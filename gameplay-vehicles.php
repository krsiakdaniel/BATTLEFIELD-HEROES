<strong>Airplane</strong>
<br />
<br />
Air support is great help indeed. There is nothing more scary than airplane closing in from behind you. Attacking from distance, fast and agile.
</p>
<p>
In case you want to learn how to fly an airplane it takes some time and certain skill but no worries.
You will get there soon so never give up. Practice makes perfection !
<br />
You will crash many times for sure. You will hit trees, buildings and other planes in the air while learning how to control it properly.
</p>
<p>
Well there is always a parachute so don&#39;t be afraid to use eject button often !
<br />
Just be so polite and warn your &#34;wingman&#34; in advance that you will jump out and won&#39;t kill him along !

<strong id="tank">Tank</strong>
<br />
<br />
Whoaa soldier ! This steel steed is heavy and steady !
<br />
<br />
Tank is heavily armored monster that fires big shells that explode on impact. The tank turret can be occupied by a second soldier. That will be your team mate who can take care of any enemy naive enough to storm your tank in close combat.
</p>
<p>I guess you will spend most of your time driving this beast slaughtering enemies with no bigger worries.</p>
<p>
Well the last chance and option is to run over all enemy soldiers, jeeps and planes on runway in order to get rid of them quickly and neatly.

<br />
<strong>Jeep</strong>
<br />
<br />
Good as always. Jeep is reliable and loyal companion !
<br />
<br />
Cars are great way how to transport yourself and two of your team mates across the battlefield. Jeep is quick, absolutely agile but it offers almost no protection from enemy gunfire !
</p>
<p>
While jeep does not have any mounted weapons to defend itself you can use your team mates to defend your jeep with their own guns.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t be fooled by jeep&#39;s terribly weak armor though.
Front bumper is good way how to get all your enemies on knees !
It is as lethal as any other weapon in Battlefield Heroes.
<br />
One direct hit equals to one sure kill !
